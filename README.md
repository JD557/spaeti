## What is Späti

Späti is a GUI for [`Coursier`](https://get-coursier.io/).

You can use it to install, update and delete packages.

The current version is still very limited and does not support any configuration,
fetching applications from both the default `apps` and `apps-contrib` channels.

## Installing

Späti is not released yet, please be patient.

In the meantime, you can run it with `cs launch eu.joaocosta:spaeti_3:latest.release -M eu.joaocosta.spaeti.main`.
